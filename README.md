Project Summary: Exploring Belfast Property Data

This project is a comprehensive exploration of Belfast property data, encompassing three key sections: data sourcing (propertypal.py), data cleaning (cleaning_data.ipynb), and data analysis (property_analysis.ipynb).

## Data Sourcing:

Leveraged web scraping techniques, specifically using Beautiful Soup, to extract property information from the PropertyPal website.
Captured essential details such as property features, prices, locations, and additional relevant data for analysis.

## Data Cleaning:

Applied robust data cleaning procedures to ensure the dataset's readiness for analysis.
Addressed issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats to enhance the overall quality of the dataset.

## Data Analysis:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unveil patterns, trends, and insights within the property dataset.
Utilized statistical techniques, including a correlation matrix, to understand relationships between different variables.
Employed feature importance analysis to identify key factors influencing property prices.
Built a price calculator function that outputs a summary of the available properties and their range of prices based on the input search criteria.
Implemented geospatial visualizations using Tableau, presenting a spatial perspective on property distributions and trends.
